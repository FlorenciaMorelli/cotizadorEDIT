# Cotizador EDIT

This repository contains "Cotizador EDIT," which was developed as the final integrative project for the Javascript From Zero course I completed at [Educación IT](https://www.educacionit.com/).

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to apply the skills and knowledge acquired during the course and previous courses to create a fully functional website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The project demonstrates my proficiency in:

- Structuring web content with semantic HTML5 elements
- Styling web pages with CSS3
- Implementing responsive design principles
- Implementing JavaScript for usage

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the website is accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Semantic HTML:** Utilizes modern HTML5 elements to improve the structure and accessibility of the content.
- **CSS3 Styling:** Includes advanced CSS techniques to create an engaging and user-friendly interface.
- **Interactive Elements:** Incorporates interactive elements such as forms, buttons, and animations to enhance the user experience.
- **JavaScript Implementation:** Resolves the logic of the program.
